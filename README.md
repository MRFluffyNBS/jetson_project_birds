# Bird ID

Have you ever seen a bird outside and wanted to identify what species it is? This project uses machine learning using the Jetson Nano to train on a database of 10 species of birds and correctly identify them from a camera or photo.

## The Algorithm

This project employs transfer learning by retraining the Resnet-18 network on a dataset of images to correctly identify the species of birds. The trained model is then exported in onnx format and processed with TensorRT using imagenet.py.
